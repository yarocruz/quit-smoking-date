# Quit Smoking Tracker - React App

This is just a simple app that I made using React. I'm very new to React and gave myself this little project to see if I'm understanding
the gist of React. I attempted in the code to make the Days, Hours and Minutes data to update without having to refresh, but couldn't figure that out. Feel free to clone it and pull request if you feel inclined to help me. You can see a live demo at [quit-smoking-date app](https://quit-smoking-date.netlify.com/)

P.S. If you're quitting smoking, or quittin anything for that matter, and want to customize this to your liking, all you need to do is enter in the quitSmokingDate: property the new Date(" ") to which ever date.
